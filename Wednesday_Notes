Client-side routing:

	•	When we send a request to our web-server, express matches the URL we’re asking for with the routes we’ve defined.
	•	Routing is matching the URL we’re asking for (the URL in the address bar) with a particular function that going to fulfil that request.
	•	The reason why we have a client-side router is we have all of our templates in the browser, we have all of our JSX our components in the browser, so all we need to do is respond to user events and apply data to those components and make the necessary change on the page.
	•	 Changing the URL in the browser and the UI (User-interface)
	•	There’s a correlation between the URL and the components which we’re seeing on our browser
	•	When you have a hash symbol in the URL, then it takes you to another part of the page
