# Lodash:
## What is Lodash?
Lodash is a javascript library which contains many methods which assists coders with functions, utilities, strings, arrays, objects, langs, sequels, and collections. 
Lodash stems from underscore which is a different framework like React. 

## What is it responsible for?
Lodash helps programmers write more concise and easier to maintain Javascript. 

## The main area’s can be broken down into several main area’s:

	•	Utilities - for simplifying common programming tasks such as determining type as well as simplifying math operations.
	•	Function - throttling, currying, decorating, changing the pointer
	•	String - conversion functions
	•	Array - creating, splitting, modifying, combining and compressing
	•	Collection - iterating, sorting, filtering, spotting and building
	•	Seq - chaining, wrapping, filtering and testing

## Examples of Lodash methods:

_.chunk(array, [size=1])
Creates an array of elements split into groups the length of size. If array can't be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.
_.compact(array)
Creates an array with all falsey values removed. The values false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN are falsey.
_.head(array)
Gets the first element of array.

## Conclusion:

Lodash provides a ton of helper functions to help you save time. The library is very light (69kb), efficient, popular and loved by coders. It is updated very often on GitHub and almost never has any issues with the package.

Lodash gives you overall better performance for dealing with large arrays/object iteration.
