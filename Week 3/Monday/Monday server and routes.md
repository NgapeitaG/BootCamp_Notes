	•	server.use is part of routing
	•	Middleware is what we use to setup our server
	•	Server.js is where we configure our server
	•	Routing is a configuration of our server
	•	Routes.js is used to define the routes
	•	Request and response is the only thing our route.js file is worried about. These are used to create routes.
	•	Our files are modules
	•	This week we’re going to have a db.js or data.js file
	•	We’ll only have one route file

	•	Solving problems with Codie bits
	•	Listening, setting up, req and res.
	•	What you’re exporting and importing
	•	Be comfortable with module.exports and require
